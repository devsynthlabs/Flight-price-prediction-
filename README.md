## 🧮 Algorithm Details

### **Safety Scoring System**

#### **Airline Safety Ratings** (Base Scores)
- **Vistara**: 9.5/10 (Premium Full-Service)
- **Air India**: 8.5/10 (National Carrier)
- **Indigo**: 8.0/10 (Low-Cost Leader)
- **SpiceJet**: 7.5/10 (Budget Airline)
- **AirAsia**: 7.0/10 (International Budget)
- **GO_FIRST**: 6.5/10 (Ultra Low-Cost)

#### **Safety Adjustments**
- **Route Complexity**: +0.5 (non-stop), +0.2 (one stop), -0.3 (multiple stops)
- **Flight Duration**: +0.4 (very short), +0.2 (short-medium), -0.3 (long flights)
- **Departure Time**: +0.2 (morning/afternoon), +0.1 (evening), -0.2 (early morning/late night)
- **Booking Advance**: +0.1 (7+ days advance booking)

### **Value Scoring Formula**
```
Value Score = (0.6 × Price Score) + (0.4 × Safety Score)

Where:
- Price Score = 10 × (1 - (Price - Min_Price) / (Max_Price - Min_Price))
- Safety Score = Comprehensive safety calculation (1-10 scale)
```
